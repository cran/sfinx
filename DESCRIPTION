Description: The straightforward filtering index (SFINX) identifies true positive
    protein interactions in a fast, user-friendly, and highly accurate way.
    It is not only useful for the filtering of affinity purification -
    mass spectrometry (AP-MS) data, but also for similar types of data
    resulting from other co-complex interactomics technologies, such as TAP-MS,
    Virotrap and BioID. SFINX can also be used via the website interface at
